  ### Coding
  The complete code can be found on ðŸ”— [GitHub](https://github.com/PikalounJM/Resort-data-analysis)

### Backgroud
- In this project, I aimed to provide **customer management insights** by analyzing current data to increase the number of active users.

### Dataset & Tool
- Customer, Point transactions(earned/used), Room booking & **R**

### Method
- To better understand our customers, I analyed customer distribution by age, grade, type, subscription period, and last login period.
- Analyzed each customer's point-earning and usage history, particularly whether points were earned at checkout. This analysis served as a basis for evaluating the efficiency of our membership system.
