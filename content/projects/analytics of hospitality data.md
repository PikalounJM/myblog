  ### Coding
  The complete code can be found in ðŸ”— [Github](https://github.com/PikalounJM/Resort-data-analysis)

### Backgroud
- In this project, I proposed **customer management insight** through analysis of our current status data to expand active users.

### Data & Tool
- Customer, Point(earn/use), Room booking **using R**

### Method
- To understand our customers, I identified customer proportions by customer age/grade/type/subscription period/last login period.
- Analyzed Point earn/use history of each customer and whether or not points are earned in checkout and used as basic data for judging the efficiency of Membership system operation.
