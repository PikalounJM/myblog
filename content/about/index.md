Hi, I'm Jimin.

 I'm a Product Owner and Data Scientist currently based in Seoul, South Korea.

I work in the hospitality industry, where I'm responsible for product operations and delivering actionable insights through data analysis and modeling to enhance customer experience.
**I am now focused on advancing my career toward becoming a Data Scientist.**

In 2022, while launching 'Locallive', which is a regional co-prosperity platform, I realized that data-driven decisions were essential for business growth.
To harneess the power of data for greater business efficiency and growth, I decided to pursue graduate studies in data science while continuing to work.

I'm confident that pursuing this path was one of the best decisions I've made. **My goal is to collaborate with talented data scientists, continuously learn, and contribute to impactful data-driven.**

I'm excited about the opportunity to grow and add value to the team.
