Hi, I'm Jimin.

 I'm Product Owner and Data Scientist living in Seoul, South Korea.

I currently work at hospitality industry like Hanwha resorts and I'm in charge of product operations and insight proposals
through data analysis and modeling to provide better services to customers.  
**And now, I'm preparing to expand my career into Data Scientist.**

Actually, When I launched e-commerce platform(Locallive) in 2022, I became interested in Big data and statistics.
However, since I had very little knowledge at that time, I decided to learn more about data and that's when I came across the field of data science.
And I did both grauate school and work.

I never regret my decision, and I believe that taking on this challenge was the best choice I ever made.
**My dream is to work with the smartest data scientists in the world.** 

So, I hope you can give me such an opportunity.
